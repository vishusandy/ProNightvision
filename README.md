# Pro Nightvision

Allows setting nightvision that is reactivated on respawn. Different custom filter types are supported, as well as the default nightvision.  A set of natives are also provided for interacting with this plugin.

Pressing `n` (or whatever key your nightvision is bound to) will turn on nightvision, reactivating the last filter you used (does not persist after leaving the server), and also displaying the nightvision menu.
